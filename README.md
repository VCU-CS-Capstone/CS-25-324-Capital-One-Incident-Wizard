# *Incident Wizard*
## *Capital One*
## *Short Project Description*
Problem Statement - “As a customer servicing platform, how can I empower agents to troubleshoot issues and create actionable incidents through an interactive and conversational tool?”
 Create a conversational incident wizard to help agents troubleshoot, pull scenario-specific documentation, and create tickets with all necessary info -
 1. Create a simple web application that helps agents perform basic troubleshooting and creates incidents.
 2. The application should be interactive and provide feedback/help similar to Eno
 3. The application should allow an agent to easily create an incident with all necessary context and data.
 4. The application should be able to suggest possible solutions based on a description of the issue that is provided by an agent.
 5. The application should be able to suggest help or solutions based on the agent’s recently completed actions.
 Assumptions:
 1. Students have access to existing AI implementations
 2. Students will have access to Service Now
